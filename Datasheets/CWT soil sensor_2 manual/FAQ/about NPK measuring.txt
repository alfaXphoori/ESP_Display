Important Reminder
The measurement of NPK adopts the general rapid detection method, so there are certain error, Use with caution for planting reference.
The existing electronic measuring method cannot accurately measure NPK, the error is big, sensor only show trend of NPK.

However, the sensor supports the function of writing NPK data. You can use standard instruments to measure NPK then write in to provide data for monitoring system.


The existing electronic measuring method cannot accurately measure NPK, the error is big, sensor only show trend of NPK.
so, it is the best way to write the value that measured by the standard instrument into the sensor


note:
Once NPK are written to any value, NPK value will not change.
can write FFFF to register of NPK to reset
